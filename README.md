# reddit-data-analysis-using-apache-hadoop-on-google-colab
This is a big data analysis project that uses apache hadoop to extract some insights on 30 gb of reddit comment data. 
All project files including the map/reduce files, and analysis outputs can be found in this drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gVD6jQDj0Dv4NZuFHJlQ_rSqWwJoAYxm?usp=sharing
in the folder, there's a google colab notebook with the codes used to download the dataset, set up the hadoop environment, and run all mapreduce jobs. Also in the drive folder is a directory named 'documentation' where a description of all analysis questions, and insights, as well as some detail of the structure of the code can be found.
